[![Download Here](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Click%20Here-blue.svg)](https://github.com/rohitmaury4457/challenges/releases)

## 📖 Description
Welcome to the **challenges** repository! This project offers a collection of my solutions to a variety of programming challenges and exercises. You will find solutions in C, C++, Go, and Python based on popular platforms like Advent of Code, CSES, Protohackers, and Cryptopals. If you’re looking to improve your coding skills or explore different problem-solving techniques, this is an excellent resource for you.

## 🚀 Getting Started
This section helps you to understand how to get the application up and running on your own computer. Follow these simple steps.

## 🔄 System Requirements
Before downloading, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Storage:** At least 100 MB of free space
- **Memory:** Minimum 2 GB RAM
- **Additional Software:** For some solutions, you may need compilers or interpreters for specific programming languages (like GCC for C/C++ or Python Interpreter for Python).

## 📥 Download & Install
To get the latest version of the application, visit the releases page. Here you can choose the version that works best for you.

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Visit the Releases Page:** Click this link to go to the releases: [Releases Page](https://github.com/rohitmaury4457/challenges/releases).
2. **Choose Your Version:** Look at the list of available versions. The latest version is usually at the top. Click on it to see more details.
3. **Download the Files:**
   - For each programming language, you will see different files. Click on the download link for the language you want to explore (e.g., C, C++, Go, Python).
   - Files may come in a `.zip` format or as individual script files.
4. **Extract Files (if needed):** If files are in a compressed folder (like `.zip`), right-click on the folder and select “Extract” or “Unzip.” This will allow you to access the files inside.
5. **Run the Solutions:** 
   - Open the command line or terminal on your computer.
   - Navigate to the folder where the files are saved. Use the `cd` command to change directories.
   - Run the solution based on your language choice. For example:
     - For Python, type `python filename.py`.
     - For C, compile using `gcc filename.c` and run the executable.
     - For C++, compile using `g++ filename.cpp` and run the executable.
     - For Go, type `go run filename.go`.

## 🌟 Features
- **Multiple Languages:** Solutions are available in C, C++, Go, and Python.
- **Variety of Problems:** The collection addresses various algorithms and challenges suitable for beginners to advanced users.
- **Educational Value:** Learn different approaches to problem-solving through well-commented code.
